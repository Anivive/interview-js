# JS Interview Project
Create a UI web application that retrieves and displays the user repositories and organizations in Github.

## UX/UI
Up to you, probably it should include an input to enter the username, one area to display the repositories of the user and another area to display the organisations

## Retrieving data
To make things easier we have committed a github-api.js file with the REST APIs needed to retrieve the information.

## Bonus (don't need to be in the below specific order)
* Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring and async/await
* Adding a spinner when information is loading
* Deal with errors coming from the backend
* Some sort of Unit Test
* Some sort of Integration Test
* A nice UI using a component library (Bootstrap, Ant Design, Material UI or another?)


## Starting the project
You may choose to do this project in Vue, React, Angular, or use vanilla Javascript.

### Vue

In the ```vue``` folder is a fresh project created with Vue CLI.

```
cd vue && npm run serve
```

### React

In the ```react``` folder is a fresh project created with ```create-react-app```.

```
cd react && npm start
```

### Angular

In the ```angular``` folder is a fresh project created with Angular CLI using the SASS stylesheet option.

```
cd angular && npm install && ng serve
```

### Vanilla JS

In the ```vanilla``` folder you will find an index.html and index.js file. 
We are using ParcelJS as a web application bundler.
                                                                                                  

```
cd vanilla && parcel index.html
```
